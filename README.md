# react-todo

A simple todo app in React that I used in the "You learnt HTML, CSS, JS now what? __Introduction to React__" workshop for Computer Society of India (CSI) - 2020 event at _Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering_.

Tinker around with the project [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ArchitBhonsle/react-todo).
